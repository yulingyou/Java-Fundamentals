# Java Fundamentals with IntelliJ Resources

Welcome to GitHub where we are hosting resources for the module "Java
Fundamentals with IntelliJ".

## Usage

Depending on the resource(s), you can freely browse this repository to see the
file(s) you need, or you can clone this GitHub repository locally - this latter
option is the way to go if you're going to be doing any of:

* Running a script locally
* Making changes to things
* Wanting to commit your own work to GitHub (N.B. in this case, remember to
  `fork` this repository to your own account, then clone that repository so you
  have permissions to push changes)
